This script is used to extract geologic maps from an ArcSDE database, but also works with file databases. The script is custom designed for a modified version of NCGMP09 (we should provide a example of that), but we will be adapting it to more fully comply with the current GEMS standards. All feature classes and feature datasets in the database should have the same prefix denoting the mapper or map product. The script then "clips" user specified feature classes to a quad boundary (this is provided as a polygon feature class with the field "Build" - all polygons with "yes" in "Build" are used as the quad boundary). A special approach using "select by location" is used to "clip" feature classes with feature linked annotations. Optional routines allow for the building of polygons (from points and lines), the removal of multi-part lines, the building of topology, the creation of frequency tables, the dropping of unneeded fields, the nulling of fields, the renaming of fields (i.e. from postgres names to GeMS names) the addition of extra componets (feature classes, extra tables, a CMU, crosssections, a DRG), the building of GeMS Glossary tables and DataSources tables from master tables, the crosswalking of fields using the GeMS AttributeByKeyValues tool (https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Info/standards/GeMS/), and the validation of the resulting database for GeMS compilance (using the ValidateDatabase method from the same toolbox) among other things.
